Hi! It’s meeee, yella. I’m trying to write more, and writing with my hand is nice but also tiring and I think I’ll write more if I’m typing it. It’s been like three months since I last wrote a blog post! I found it quite hard to have the mental energy after traveling and exploring all day to sit down and focus on writing. But that’s just a tired excuse - I think what I really need is to create a habit out of it, a routine. Find myself in a familiar space with it, and own it as a daily practice, just like yoga and meditation. Daily is also a high goal, semi-daily is more likely, I believe it’s important to give yourself days where you’re not expecting anything from yourself, and you let yourself just give in to the adventure of the day.

We’re in Virginia now at my parents’ house, we spent a couple weeks in San Francisco and Oakland catching up with friends and Ash’s family, and being reminded of how much we love the bay area <3 These days are filled with planning our Europe trip, working out at the local gym, and eating sooo much amazing Italian food that my mom makes. I’m super grateful for having this space and opportunity to rest in between travels and to spend time with family. Though, I must also acknowledge that this time is also filled with its own particular kinds of anxieties. Things like - am I doing enough? Should I actually be working? Is it really ok to just rest? Looking at the big picture I know the answer is yes, it is okay to just rest, but it’s always a daily reminder that many of society’s expectations tell us it’s not okay, and that we need to constantly be productive.

I’m the type to make lists. I like to plan and structure what I’ll do eventually, but seeing an outline really helps to guide me. So I’d like to list out my next few blog posts that I hope to write:

- Hiking to the Base del Torres on Day 3 of our Patagonia guided W-trek
- Traveling to El Calafate and hiking on the Perito Moreno Glacier
- Taking the bus to El Chalten (GORGEOUS) and hiking to Mirador Fitz Roy
- A week of reflection in Bariloche’s Lake Nahuel Huapi
- Finding community in Buenos Aires
- Rainbows and Boat tours at Iguazu Falls
- Rio de Janeiro Carnevale and the Parade of Champions
- History, Food, and House Parties in Lima, Peru (P.S. WE LOVED IT ALL)
- Four days trekking the Andes mountains from Cusco to Machu Picchu
- Exploring the beautiful city of Cartagena
- 3 week Yoga Teacher Training at Akasha Yoga School!!
- Spending three days in the small fishing village of Taganga in Colombia
