Hi its Ash,
We wanna thank you for being here, for wanting to keep in touch and being in our lives. This past year flew by so fast.  It feels like as soon as I met Daniela we started celebrating immediately. We traveled to many places and danced so much this year. We got to meet each other's friends and family and have had so much fun being in love and starting this journey together. 

Early on, Daniela told me it was her dream to travel the world. This was my dream too when I was younger I remember having airplanes as my facebook header haha and told myself I'd be a jetsetter one day. I didn't know what was possible until I met Daniela. She asked me to go with her on this trip and I went from "how the heck?" to "why not?" to "oh snap we're doing this." 

One thing I've reflected on that's stuck with me is that this is not something I will regret. I'm not getting any younger and if not now then when? I grew up looking up to my aunties and their love for the outdoors and travel. My auntie Lizette and auntie Grace and auntie Clarissa were always off having adventures in different countries. I never thought it would be possible for me to walk in their footsteps. 

I'm nervous as hell but I heard that's the same chemical reaction in your brain as excitement. I can't wait to see the world with the person I love and who's made all this possible. This year, I fell in love and next year we're traveling the world. That's a hella dope sentence I never thought I would be able to say. I don't have all the answers yet but we're manifesting something great here and I'm so grateful you're here for the ride. We can't wait to share our adventures with you and keep you all updated. Stay tuned for videos and blogs in the next few weeks. 

Day 1 starts on January 10 in Santiagooooo! Check out our itinerary page if you're curious about the world tour dates <3
